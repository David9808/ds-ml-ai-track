## New Feature Description
**Text File Capabiilities**: I think it'd be good to be able to analyze unconventional data alongside structured ones so I've added a feature that allows a user to be able to upload a text file in a timestamped log format (a format used in exported message chats) and it is automatically converted to a data frame that the app can process and analyze.  
Here's what a user will see if this feature is approved.
